A guide to editing panels:
--------------------------

New panels:
-----------

The 'New' item in the Panels menu creates a new panel window ready for you
to edit.  The panel name is of little significance, you can rename it using
the panel editor described below. You can create more than one new panel at 
the same time if you wish.


Add an item:
------------

To add an item such as a button or field into a panel just hold the mouse
down and drag it to open a outline rectangle in an unused area of the window,
i.e., an area that does not contain any part of any existing item. When the
mouse button is released a 'New…' button will appear. Click on this button
to obtain a pop-up menu of available items.  Select an item from this
menu, and such an item will be pasted into the panel at the location of the
'New…' button. (Note that the 'New…' button can be moved before selection, 
just as you would move any other object; see below.)


Move an item:
-------------

Select an item by dragging an outline rectangle as described above, overlapping
the item (or items) you wish to move. When the mouse button is released,
the selected item(s) will be inverted. (This is modelled after selecting file
system objects in the Mac Finder.)  An item can also be selected by clicking
on an item when the control key is depressed. To move the item(s), just pick 
somewhere in the center of a selected item to hold the mouse down, and drag the
mouse to the new location (as in the Finder). The items can be unselected by 
clicking outside any items in the panel. (Control clicking a selected item 
will also unselect it.)


Re-size an item:
----------------

Many items can be re-sized, just select the item as described above and
drag the grow box in the bottom right hand corner.


Cut/Copy/Paste:
---------------

Standard cut/copy/paste techniques are applicable to selections in panels.
When a copy is made in the clipboard, it is a literal copy, including
names and positions.  A subsequent paste operation adds the selection in
the clipboard to the active panel, replacing any current selection.


Editing items:
--------------

Every item is an instance of a class with an associated list of properties,
which always includes a name property and a place property, as well as class
specific properties such as style, font information, associated menus, etc.  
Properties, other than the place, can be changed by double clicking on the 
item when selected, causing the editor for that object's class to be invoked.  
The interface to the class editors is in turn a panel permitting interactive
modification of the item properties.  Clicking on the 'OK' button exits the 
editor; clicking on the 'Cancel' button exits the editor and restores the 
object to the state it was in when the editor was entered.

The supplied dialogs for buttons, fields and lists should be fairly 
self-explanatory, but here's a few tips:

 1. Each of the supplied dialogs uses a combination list/field to create an 
    editable list.  Just enter lines in the field (only the bottom line is 
    displayed) and hit <enter>; each  line is added to the list after the 
    current list selection, or at the end of the list if there is no selection.
    Doubleclicking on a list selection places the selection in the field 
    where it can be editied.  On leaving edit, the contents will replace the 
    current selection; if the contents are empty, the selection will be deleted.
    The list can be reordered within the visible list by dragging the selection 
    to another position in the list.

 2. The 'Icon' check box in the button editor is used to delete the icon; an 
    icon is selected from the icon list.

 3. The font must be selected from the popup menu, but the size doesn't have to
    be selected from the available sizes.  Just don't select the size from the
    popup and you'll be left editing the size field.  (If you don't enter a 
    valid integer, the previous size will be restored.)


The item names are used to identify items in a panel, to permit reading or 
writing information into a field, for example, or to know which button has 
been clicked. Names do not have to be unique, you can discriminate on the 
basis of the class or other properties of item: button(fred) or 
field(name(fred),place(20,20,_..),Ps..) for example.


Deleting Items:
---------------

Items can be deleted by selecting them and dragging them off the edge of the
window, or using the delete key. 


Panel Grid:
-----------

For interactive editing purposes only, panels have a grid whose default pitch
is 4 pixels.  When new items are created all sides are aligned to the grid.
When they are dragged, the top and left sides are aligned, i.e., their size
does not change (just in case the grid pitch was changed since the item was
created.  When they are grown, the bottom and right sides are aligned to the
grid, i.e., the top left corner does not change.  The grid pitch can be changed
using the panel editor described below. (The grid pitch must be an integer
greater than zero.)


Panel window size and location:
-------------------------------

You may move or grow the panel window in the same manner as any other window,
the final size and position will be saved at the end of your editing. In 
addition to their title bar (if they have one, they can be dragged by a bar 
16 pixels in height at the top of the panel. There is also a resize box 16 
pixels square at the bottom right hand corner of each panel. (Note: some 
panel styles, e.g., rounded, do not provide visual feedback while they're 
resizing, but they are resizing.) These generic drag and grow regions are 
only active in areas not covered by other objects, i.e., object behaviour 
takes precedence. (Thus transparent buttons with no label, which are normally 
invisible, can be used to disable dragging and growing in an inobtrusive way.)
Also, locked panels, i.e., panels which can't be changed, cannot be resized,
although they can be moved.


Panel Editing:
--------------

Double clicking in the panel, but not in any item, will open a panel editor.
The panel editor allows the user to change such panel properties as the name,
style, grid pitch, background colour, pattern or picture, and options to prevent 
further panel editing or to enforce modal dialog behaviour.  Clicking on the
'OK' button exits the editor; clicking on the 'Cancel' button exits the editor 
and restores the panel to the state it was in when the editor was entered.

Picture backgrounds are specified by a file name (path) and a resource id
(integer).  If no file name is specified, the picture must be found in the
currently open resource forks.


Close to end your editing:
--------------------------

Click the panel window close box (or use 'Close' in the 'File' menu) to end your
editing and capture a description of the panel layout.  If the panel has not 
previously been saved, you will be asked to provide a file name.


To edit an existing panel:
--------------------------

Any panel can be edited once it's been opened. On closing the panel, the user
is promted whether he wishes to save any outstanding changes. However, the
changes do not take effect until the modified file is reloaded; panels does
not automatically load anything.
