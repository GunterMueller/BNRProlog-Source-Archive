Rtest0002	Notes:
=====================

	The 'rtest0002?' files are prolog contexts each with a main test predicate.

	'rtest0002' and 'rtest0002.1' are 'big bang' tests...they run all the test combinations and permutations.

	'rtest0002a-d' allow for a more precise application of tests with main predicates 'unify_a-d'..
	
	'rtest0002t' contains tests, test types and test values each with reference values. These references facilitate 
		the precise selection of tests and values.
		
	
	The tests:
	---------
	'unify_a' runs each test value against each test type looking for 'obvious' unification problems.
	'unify_b' runs groups of test values against each other for a nominated test.
	'unify_c' performs simple unification of groups of test values, singly or in lists, against each other.
	'unify_d' performs simple unification of test values or groups of test values, singly or in lists, against each other.
	
	
	NB: 'unify_d' provides the most flexibility.
